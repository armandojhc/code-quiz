First project utilizing html, CSS and jquery to create a timed short quiz comprised of 5 multiple choice questions related to basic javascrip concepts. 

Objective: From scratch, build a timer-based quiz application that stores high scores client-side. 


How to use:

Step 2 - Click the "Start Quiz" button and this will trigger the time to start counting down. The length of the array in questions.js determines the length of play. Fifteen seconds per question so 5 questions will result in a length of play of 75 seconds.
